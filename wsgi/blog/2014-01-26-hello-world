## Greetings

This is just a test post to see how various formatting elements will be handled
by this flask-based blog. It's a flat-file blog, integrated into the rest of
our flask-based website. 

### Formatting and such

For now, the layout of these posts follows the layout of our meetings and other
site content pretty closely, but we'll be working on it.
