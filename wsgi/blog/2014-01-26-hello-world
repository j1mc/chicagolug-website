## Greetings

This is just a test post to see how various formatting elements will be handled
by this flask-based blog. It's a flat-file blog, integrated into the rest of
our flask-based website. 

### Formatting and such

For now, the layout of these posts follows the layout of our meetings and other
site content pretty closely. We'll be working on that, though. Until we get
that worked out, we probably won't be publicizing this blog too much. That's
all right, though.

Cheers!
