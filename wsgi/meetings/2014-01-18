We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, January 18th, starting at
2:00pm. We'll be meeting at our regular spot,
[Pumping Station: One] [0].

Speaking Topics
---------------

Drew Fustini will show off the features of the open hardward platform, 
[BeagleBone Black] [1]. It's similar in form and function to the more
widely-known Raspberry Pi hardware platform, but the BeagleBone is open
hardware. We'll have more details on Drew's presentation as we get closer to
the meeting date.

Hacking
-------

After Drew's presentation we'll have time to hack on projects of our
choosing, so bring something that you're looking to hack on!


Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation] [2], but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars
if you want to partake of pizza and drinks.
