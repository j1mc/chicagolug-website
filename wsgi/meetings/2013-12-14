We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, December 14th, starting at
12:00pm. We'll be meeting at our regular spot,
[Pumping Station: One] [0].

Speaking Topics
---------------

Bonnie King will discuss [Red Hat Software Collections] [1], and how they're
packaged and used in Scientific Linux. 

Jeff Schroeder will also discuss the [Graphite Project] [2]. Graphite stores
numeric time-series data, and render graphs of this data on demand.

Hacking . . . we will have none. Festivities, we will have them.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike regular meetings, we will not be hacking. Instead, we'll have holiday
good times.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
