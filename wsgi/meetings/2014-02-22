We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, February 22nd, with formal talks
starting at 2:00 pm. We'll be meeting at our regular spot, 
[Pumping Station: One] [0].

For those who are interested, we'll also have some time before the meeting for
some informal project hacking. The informal, pre-meeting hacking will start at
12:00 pm. 

Speaking Topics
---------------

Our speaking topics are currently TBD, so let us know if you're interested in
giving a talk this month.

Hacking
-------

To give people more quiet time for working, you're welcome to join us and hack
on projects before the meeting, starting at about noon. This isn't scheduled
time, and we might have to be flexible about where we do our work, but you're
encouraged to bring something that you've been working on. Others will be there
to do work as well, and we can help each other, or just work quietly.

If you have the time, you can also stay to hack on your projects after the
talks. It can get a little noisy after the talks, but you can still get stuff
done if you're focused.  :)


Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation] [1], but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars
if you want to partake of pizza and drinks.
